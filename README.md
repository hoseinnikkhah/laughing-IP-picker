# laughing-IP-picker
I used two different tools in this repo and automated most of the tasks provided on internet, IPs are picked from bot.sudoer.net and checked in Cloud Flare Speed Test app I translated.

a pyton script has been written in ordr to transfer IPs without whitespace into CloudFlareSpeedTest tool. this means you don't need to copy and past IPs yourself, everything is automated.

> # How to use
```
Run GetIP.bat and wait until it asks you to press enter
Run executed.exe and wait for results.csv
Tool picks 10 of fastest IPs for you
```

I will release linux and mac versions soon.
